## What is imposter syndrome?
Imposter syndrome (IS) is the “false and sometimes crippling belief that one’s successes are the product of luck or fraud rather than skill. Individuals who experience it may feel self-doubt and a lack of confidence in their own abilities.Interestingly, even people who are high achievers and extremely successful often fall victim to these feelings.

## How to know if I am suffering from it?
Characteristics of Imposter Syndrome - 
-Self-doubt
-An inability to realistically assess your competence and skills
-Attributing your success to external factors
-Berating your performance
-Fear that you won't live up to expectations
-Overachieving 
-Sabotaging your own success
-Self-doubt
-Setting very challenging goals and feeling disappointed when you fall short
Some people can actually use this feeling as a fuel to achieve their goals, which comes with a price of constant anxiety, over preparing one’s self and pushing one’s boundary way, to make people believe that he/she is not a fraud.

##How can it affect me?
A new beginning in some phase of life is usually underlined with a slight hint of Imposter Syndrome. But, it has to be made sure that it does not build up. Something as common as the incident mentioned above can result in the feelings. 

## How's it different from social anxiety?
Impostor syndrome and social anxiety may overlap. A person with social anxiety disorder (SAD) may feel as though they don't belong in social or performance situations.
While the symptoms of social anxiety can fuel feelings of imposter syndrome, this does not mean that everyone with imposter syndrome has social anxiety or vice versa. People without social anxiety can also feel a lack of confidence and competence. Imposter syndrome often causes normally non-anxious people to experience a sense of anxiety when they are in situations where they feel inadequate.

## Maybe I am the only one having all this in my head?
No,you aren't.
Types of people exhibiting the Syndrome:
Imposter syndrome can appear in a number of different ways.
1.**The Perfectionist**: The one who is never satisfied and always feel that they could do the work at hand, better.
2.**The Superhero**: These individuals feel inadequate and hence push themselves to work hard.
3.**The Expert**: These individuals are always learning more and are never satisfied with their level of understanding.

## But,why?
 Self doubt and Imposter Syndrome permeate the workplace and professionals are commonly seen to be affected by this. Studies show that IS hits women, more than men and certain researches have shown that women are less likely to be promoted as Managers in corporates than men. The reason can be simply deciphered as their commitments in the sphere of life and lack of role models, which has thus resulted in this. Women suffering from Post-partum syndrome, often can get pushed to suffer from IS. 70% of women in tech suffer from imposter syndrome in their day to day lives. Even after being accomplished, they doubt their skills and don't have a positive outlook towards things.

Thinking about how to deal with it, we have come up with an application, which can actually help them normalise their lives, to certain extent, where they are capable of taking We have built our app to empower these women to do their best work while being ensured 


## What it does
It creates a brag list for people with imposter syndrome where they can put in the smallest of achievements that they're proud of. They can look at the list whenever in a moment of weakness. Apart from this we also have a gratitude list that is accessible every morning to remind women to be grateful for the amenities they are privileged to have. We provide various actionable items for users to perform on a daily basis without having to research a lot. These items are divided into categories to induce assertiveness, positivity, and improve mental health. These are very well-research scientifically proven tips that anyone with abundant stress can try to make their lives better.

## Challenges 
The initial setup of the app was a bit tedious, integrating the ideals and putting together everything. Once we were able to overcome the initial roadblocks, from then on it was pretty much a smooth sail.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Not having much experience in mobile app development, piecing together a working app within 24 hrs.

## What's next for niyamo
Scaling it to a larger scale, with added features such as multi - lingual support, etc.
